    <p>Toten Ode combines his hatred of the empire with an over-blown sense of self-importance and
    extreme naivet√© into a potent package of amateurish, mostly ineffective spycraft oriented
    towards fostering a nascent dissident element in the area.</p>
    <p>In reality, there are a number of local dissidents who cause the empire no end of trouble.
    These individuals make use of Ode from time to time in order to place misinformation in the
    hands of imperial agents.  Indeed, likely the only reason Ode has not been arrested is that
    local security forces believe him to be a use conduit for dissident activities.  Imperial agents
    are rapidly becoming wise to the fact that Ode is not actually trusted with any information of
    real value, though, so his days are probably numbered.
    <p>At least one time, though, Toten Ode somehow manages to obtain information which is clearly
    dangerous to the Empire.  With typically awful spycraft, he passes this information on to the
    player, and thus our story begins.</p>
