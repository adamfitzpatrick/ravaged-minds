    - Bardic Performance
    - >
      <p>You magically manipulate others through oration,
      music, and other special performances.</p>
      <p>To use one of these magical performances, you
      must speak or play an instrument as an action. Maintaining
      the performance requires concentration,
      as some spells do (see the rules for magic). You can
      switch to a different performance by taking another
      action. The whole effect, whether it is composed of
      one performance or several, can last no longer than
      10 minutes, and it ends early if you are silenced. You
      can’t use this feature again until you rest for at least
      10 minutes.</p>
      <p>A creature can be affected by only one of these
      performances at a time. If two or more bards try to
      affect the same creature with such performances, the
      creature is affected by neither.<p>
      <p><strong>Call to Battle:</strong> While you perform Call to Battle,
      friendly creatures, including you, are inspired to
      fight with greater zeal while within 25 feet of you. An
      affected creature can roll an extra d4 when rolling
      damage for melee and ranged attacks.</p>
      <p><strong>Eviscerating Wit:</strong> You learn Eviscerating Wit, a new
      use for your Bardic Performance. You can perform it
      to plant the seeds of doubt in your foes’ minds, using
      barbed insults and scathing satire to undermine their
      confidence.</p>
      <p>While you perform it, each hostile creature within
      50 feet of you that can understand you must make a
      Charisma saving throw against your bard spell save
      DC at the start of its turn. On a failed save, the creature
      has disadvantage on all ability checks while it
      remains in the performance’s radius.</p>
      <p>On a successful save, the creature becomes
      immune to this performance for 10 minutes.</p>
      <p><strong>Fascinating Performance:</strong> You learn Fascinating
      Performance, a new use for your Bardic Performance.
      While you perform it, each creature within
      50 feet of you that isn’t hostile to you must make a
      Wisdom saving throw against your bard spell save
      DC at the start of its turn. On a failed save, the target
      is charmed by you until the performance ends or
      the target leaves its radius. A charmed target cannot
      move or take actions and makes Wisdom (Perception)
      checks with disadvantage.</p>
      <p>If you or another creature draws or brandishes a
      weapon or casts a spell, each charmed creature can
      make a new Wisdom saving throw to end the effect.
      If any of the targets take damage or is otherwise
      harmed, this effect ends for all of them.<p>
      <p>If you make an attack or cast a spell that affects
      anyone but yourself, this effect ends. You cannot use
      this Bardic Performance if you or any creature
      that would be affected by it is currently engaged in
      combat.</p>
      <p><strong>Inspire Competence:</strong> Your performance of
      Inspire Competence fills friendly creatures with confidence
      while they are within 25 feet of you. When
      you start this performance, choose one of the six abilities.
      An affected creature can add your proficiency
      bonus to any check it makes with the chosen ability.</p>
      <p>As an action, you can change the affected ability.</p>

      <p>As a gatherer of esoteric knowledge, you learn a few
      tricks and surprises from your research and travels.
      Bards dabble in a variety of different kinds of magic,
      picking up a few things here and there. You learn
      spells that you can cast a certain number of times per
      day, and know cantrips, which you can cast at will.
      <strong>Spells per Day.</strong> Your bard level determines the
      number of spells that you can cast of 1st level or
      higher. You must complete a long rest to regain any
      castings—also called spell slots—that you use.</p>
      <table style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
        <th>Spells per Day</th>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Spell Level</td><td>1</td><td>2</td>
          </tr><tr>
            <td>Spell Slots</td><td>4</td><td>2</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <strong>Spells Known.</strong> You know three 1st-level spells,
      one 2nd-level spell, and two cantrips, which are presented
      in this character. You learn more spells as you
      gain levels, as detailed on the Bard table in the full
      description of the class. The spells you learn must be
      of a level that you can cast or a cantrip.
      <strong>Casting a Prepared Spell.</strong> When you cast one of
      the bard spells that you know, you expend a casting of
      the spell’s level or higher. For example, if you have the
      1st-level spell cure wounds prepared and can still cast
      a 1st-level spell and a 2nd-level spell, you can cast
      cure wounds at either level.
      <strong>Magic Ability.</strong> Charisma is your magic ability for
      your bard spells. The saving throw DC to resist one
      of your spells equals 8 + your Charisma modifier. If
      you are holding a musical instrument when you cast
      a spell, you add your proficiency bonus to the spell’s
      saving throw DC.
