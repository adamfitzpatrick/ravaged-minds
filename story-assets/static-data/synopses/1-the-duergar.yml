    The Duergar are an isolated, distrusted and distrustful people.  Also known as Gray Dwarves, they
    are close kin to dwarves, but long split from their cousins by a dark and troubled past.  Many
    feel that the duergar are irrepairably tainted by evil and have no place in decent society.
  </p>
  <p>
    Duergar economies are based almost exclusively on slave trading, and all professions in duergar
    societies support this trade in some manner.  Their societies are organized into tightly-knit
    clan structures, each of which engages in fierce competition for control of the slave trade
    wherever their territories come into contact with each other.  Given the nature of such
    competition, major conflicts between duergar clans are not uncommon.  At times, these conflicts
    have spilled out of the creature's subterrainian dens, resulting in damage to imperial properties
    and citizens.  A number of campaigns have been undertaken in recent history to curtail these
    conflicts and teach the clans involved the importance of conducting their internecine squabbles
    without troubling our Empire and it's august rulers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Given the importance of the slave trade to the duergar people, it is not surprising that
    a complex set of societal rules have emerged around slave ownership, management, handling and
    disposal.  While many rules may be well documented within any given clan's lore, others are
    maintained exclusively by oral tradition.  As a member of a duergar clan, it is expected that
    one would be aware of all such laws, both written and unwritten, and that one would abide by
    them without hesitation or question.  As an interesting sidenote, it is not unheard of for a
    clan elder to site laws which may or may not actually exist in order to maintain control and
    discipline.
  </p>
  <p>
    Any clan member who fails to abide by such culturally sensitive mores, whether genuine or
    contrived, will be lucky to survive the experience.  Those who are not executed outright are
    almost always branded and banished from the clan.  Branding consists of ritual disfigurement
    of the left check with a stylized rune indicative of "disgraced thief non-person".
  </p>
  <p>
    Trading slaves, both among duergars and between a duergar clan and outside interests, is
    usually a complex and highly ritualized process.  There are contracts, contract negotiations,
    as well as constant meddling by deurgar <em>Mi'Ragh mor Laguth</em> (roughly translated as "Asset
    Control Masters") who draw the process out and attempt to ensure as favorable an outcome as
    possible for the clan in question.  If one pays a duergar only twice the reasonable value for a
    given slave, it can be assumed that one "got off easy" in the transaction.

  <p><strong>History</strong></p>
  <p>
    Initially, the duergar were a clan of shield dwarves in the dwarven kingdom of Barakuir,
    located within the ancient realm of Shanatar. Clan Duergar, which venerated Laduguer as their
    patron, was an ambitious and powerful clan, believing that they should lead the kingdoms of
    Shanatar themselves. When they were denied following the Second Spider War, Clan Duergar turned
    away from the other dwarven clans, paying only lip service to Shanatar's rulers. This proved a
    mistake when the mind flayers of Oryndoll, seeing the isolation of Barakuir, attacked the realm
    in −8100 DI, enslaving or killing most of the population.
  </p>
  <p>
    During their captivity, which lasted for generations, the mind flayers performed many cruel and
    unusual experiments on the dwarves. It was during this harsh period in their history that the
    duergar, desperate and believing that Moradin had abandoned them, turned to the worship of
    devils, cementing their ties to the fiends and eventually even breeding with them. Eventually,
    the resulting race rose up against their captors and gained their freedom from the mind flayers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now free, the duergar carved out a new home for themselves beneath the Great Glacier, founding
    the city of Gracklstugh in −3717 DI. The Deepkingdom spread rapidly through the northern reaches
    of the Underdark, reaching its peak in −2600 DI before a war with the quaggoths of Ursandunthar
    caused it to enter a gradual decline, battling the remnants of the nation and urged on by drow
    for centuries thereafter.

    Further to the south, beneath central Perchine, the duergar established Dunspeirrin underneath
    the Orsraun Mountains, which grew to encompass the caverns beneath Turmish and the Tilithad
    Coast. Dunspeirrin reached its height of power in −1800 DI, when Queen Duerra defeated an
    alliance of drow from Undreath and the mind flayers of Oryndoll, reclaiming Deep Shanatar and
    Alatorin. As her divine reward, Duerra was raised to godhood by Laduguer. Afterward, however,
    the duergar of Dunspeirrin fell into a decline from which they have never recovered.
  </p>
  <p>
    Today, the duergar are scattered widely throughout the underdark, with no one clan in ascendancy
    and no great cities.  In general, they live poor, squalid lives, dreaming of once again
    gaining dominance, and constantly fighting amongst each other for favored trade arrangements with
    the empire.
