    Our story begins on a hazy day in mid August.  This far north, the wind blows with chilling
    effect even at this time of year, and storms are liable to roll up out of the tundra to the north.
  </p>
  <p>
    The player is commissioned by Toten Ode to intercept a singlular shipment coming down the
    Keelibaus Ridge.  It seems like a simple enough assignment - ambush the cart at an advantageous
    point during its descent of the ridge, kill the guards and take the cargo.  At this point, Ode
    doesn't know what the cargo is, only that it is not the usual transport of fresh slaves that
    comes down the ridge from the steppes above.
  </p>
  <p>
    All is not as it seems, though.  The shipment is protected by outriders who will make a proper
    ambush difficult, as they will warn the soldiers guarding the cart of any attack.  Additionally,
    the cart is protected not only by the usual complement of mounted guards and foot soldiers, but
    by a wizard, as well.
  </p>
  <p>
    Two mounted imperial guards lead the cart by a distance of approximately 100 yards, prepared to
    warn the van of any attempted ambush.  Two more guards ride in the cart, with two more mounted
    guardsman protecting the rear.
  </p>
  <p>
    The cargo is tied down to the center of the cart, consisting of a single large steel cell.
    Inside is an old man of unknown origin; from the demeanor of the guards and (especially) the
    wizard, it is clear that the old man is seen as a significant and unpredictable threat.  There
    is a significant chance (as needed to keep the encounter balanced for the player) that the old
    man has cause a collapse of the roadway during the caravan's descent of the ridge, costing the
    lives of one or more guards.
