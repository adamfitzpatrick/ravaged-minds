    Upon returning to the Dreamy Creek, the player discovers quite a different environment from
    the usual atmosphere.  A bard plays upon an improvised stage to the left of the bar, a jangling
    tune pouring from his guitar, and bawdy lyrics tumbling from his lips.  A large crowd has
    gathered in the common room, consisting of approximately a dozen soldiers, and perhaps twenty
    or so commoners.
  </p>
  <p>
    Should the player examine the crowd more closely, she will discern the presence of the sergent
    from her previous visit sitting in the corner nearest the inn's door.  He wears an express of
    disgust, and is not even attempting to disguise his interest in (and anger towards) her.
  </p>
  <p>
    On a DC 5 perception check, the player notes that the commoners in the crowd look better dressed
    and certainly better fed than any of the local towns people and farmers.  They may even
    outnumber the entire population of the surrounding countryside.
  </p>
  <p>
    On a DC 10 perception check, the player notices that the bard is keeping tabs on her position
    and movements through the bar.  On a DC 15 check, she notices that he manages to monitor her
    movements, while simultaneously playing without a hitch and making repeated carefully
    orchestrated movements of his left leg.  Although its appears comical on casual examination,
    it is clear to the player that these movements are intended to communicate to certain members
    of the crowd.  Upon noting this, the player realizes that there are two distinct groups in the
    watching crowd.  One group is stiff, silent and watchful.  The other is jocular, and engaged in
    lively conversation and some singing along with the bard.  The two crowds are nearly balanced in
    size.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the player watches for a while, she may notice that from time to time, another member of the
    jocular crowd seems to appear magically from the direction of the inn's kitchen.  It's as if
    one crowd is trying to over power the other by sheer presence.  It doesn't take long for the
    crowd sizes to become significantly mismatched.
  </p>
  <p>
    The player receives a cold reception from Toten Ord. He presents a hostile mein and rebuffs
    attempts at conversation.  When pressed, he angrily whispers that she "fucked things up", and
    that she would do well to clear out of town.  First, though, he suggests that she "sit the fuck
    down", and "shut the fuck up".
  </p>
  <p>
    He ignores any attempts at further conversation.
  </p>
  <p>
    At some point, the player may notice a member of the stiff crowd make a lunge at a member of
    the joculars.  At that point, the situation devolves into a massive, deadly brawl between the
    stiffs (the local soldiers) and the joculars (an unknown gang).  During the brawl, the bard
    (Mathalos) will cast message and send the following to the player: "Get out now.
    You are wanted and considered extremely dangerous.  They'll kill you if it takes the entire
    garrison. Flee to the kitchen."
  </p>
  <p>
    If the player flees, a number of Mathalos' gang will be there to lead her away.  Should she stay,
    After about 12 rounds of battle, the garrison will be deployed in full.  They won't attempt to
    enter the battle, but will simply set the inn on fire while the remaining soldiers attempt to
    escape.

    <strong>Combat:</strong>10 imperial guardsman vs 16 fighters from Mathalos's gang.  Toten flees.
