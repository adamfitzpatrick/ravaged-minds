description: >
  There are eight seasoned seaman aboard the Sea Wyvern.  At the moment the ship is approaching the area, 4 crewman are
  on deck and preparing to direct the ship during its descent through the locks.  These seaman are attending to their
  duties, and may be fairly easy to surprise (DC 5 stealth if the PCs attempt to board near the stern, DC 15 if they
  attempt it closer to the bow).  The other 4 seaman are sleeping soundly below decks.  Should a pitched battle occur on
  deck, there is a 50% chance each round that they will come on deck to investigate.  On a successful knowledge check
  (DC 10 intelligence, perception, etc), the PCs will understand that they must board from the stern, incapacitate the
  helmsman.  At the DMs discretion it maybe appropriate to point out the option of barricading the hatch to the 'tween
  decks.  It's an easy thing to prevent the other sailors from assisting those on deck.
