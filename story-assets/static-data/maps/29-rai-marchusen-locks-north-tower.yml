description: >
  Two imperial guardsmen are stationed in the north tower.  For the most part, they are incredibly bored.  One
  guardsman is inside the tower, dozing.  The other is on the roof of the short tower, preparing to use a special
  lighting device (built into the ballista) to illuminate the ship as it traverses the locks; his attention is mostly
  on the approaching ship.  Two orcs are making a slow guard circuit along the granite lock walls, through the tower and
  crossing the jetty to the shore before retracing their step.  The circuit takes about 10 minutes for them to walk.
  The players can surprise the guard atop the tower (DC 10) provided the orcs are not facing the tower (DC 15 if they
  are).  Should combat occur atop the tower, the orcs will definitely come running.  There is a 50% chance per round
  that the guards on the south tower will notice.  Should the south tower be alerted to the presence of the PCs, three
  additional guards will arrive at the south tower within three rounds, assuming the locks are closed.  Three more
  guards will arrive during each of the next two rounds, finally followed by two more orc in the next round.  Should
  the locks be open, no guards will arrive, although they will begin firing the ballistas on the south tower roof.
