For story, images and yaml files in `story-assets` directory can be modified, including the favicon
can be modified.  They must be modified according to the appropriate model contained in the app
folder.  The image file to be used for that application backdrop must be named `backdrop.png` and
global map (whether it is actually a globe, a city or a dungeon) must be named `global-map.png`.
